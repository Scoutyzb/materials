                        Although historically materials discovery has been driven by a laborious trial-and-error
                        process,
                        knowledge-driven materials design can now be enabled by the
                        rational combination of Machine Learning methods and materials databases. Here, data from the
                        AFLOW
                        repository for ab initio calculations is combined with Quantitative
                        Materials Structure-Property Relationship models to predict important properties:
                        metal/insulator
                        classification, band gap energy, bulk/shear moduli, Debye
                        temperature and heat capacities. The prediction’s accuracy compares well with the quality of the
                        training data for virtually any stoichiometric inorganic crystalline material,
                        reciprocating the available thermomechanical experimental data. The universality of the approach
                        is
                        attributed to the construction of the descriptors: Property-Labelled Materials Fragments.
                        The representations require only minimal structural input allowing straightforward
                        implementations
                        of simple heuristic design rules.

                        Using finite-temperature phonon calculations and machine-learning methods, we assess the
                        mechanical
                        stability of about 400 semiconducting oxides and
                        fluorides with cubic perovskite structures at 0, 300, and 1000 K. We find 92 mechanically stable
                        compounds at high temperatures—including 36 not mentioned in the
                        literature so far—for which we calculate the thermal conductivity. We show that the thermal
                        conductivity is generally smaller in fluorides than in oxides,
                        largely due to a lower ionic charge, and describe simple structural descriptors that are
                        correlated
                        with its magnitude. Furthermore, we show that the thermal
                        conductivities of most cubic perovskites decrease more slowly than the usual T<sup>-1</sup>
                        behavior. Within this set, we also screen for materials exhibiting negative thermal
                        expansion. Finally, we describe a strategy to accelerate the discovery of mechanically stable
                        compounds at high temperatures.

                        <br><span>Abstract:<br></span> Metallic glasses attract considerable interest due
                        to their unique combination of superb properties and processability. Predicting their
                        formation from known alloy parameters remains the major hindrance to the discovery of new
                        systems.
                        Here, we propose a descriptor based on the heuristics that structural and energetic ‘confusion’
                        obstructs crystalline growth, and demonstrate its validity by experiments on two well-known
                        glass-forming
                        alloy systems. We then develop a robust model for predicting glass formation ability based on
                        the
                        geometrical
                        and energetic features of crystalline phases calculated ab initio in the AFLOW framework. Our
                        findings indicate
                        that the formation of metallic glass phases could be much more common than currently thought,
                        with
                        more than 17% of
                        binary alloy systems potential glass formers. Our approach pinpoints favourable compositions and
                        demonstrates
                        that smart descriptors, based solely on alloy properties available in online repositories, offer
                        the
                        sought-after
                        key for accelerated discovery of metallic glasses.

                        Predicting material properties of off-stoichiometry systems remains a
                        long-standing and formidable challenge in rational materials design. A proper analysis
                        of such systems by means of a supercell approach requires the exhaustive
                        consideration of all possible superstructures, which can be a time-consuming
                        process. On the contrary, the use of quasirandom approximants, although very
                        computationally effective, implicitly bias the analysis toward disordered states with
                        the lowest site correlations. Here, we propose a novel framework designed specifically
                        to investigate stoichiometrically driven trends of disordered systems (i.e., having
                        partial occupation and/or disorder in the atomic sites). At the heart of the approach
                        is the identification and analysis of unique supercells of a virtually equivalent
                        stoichiometry to the disordered material. We employ Boltzmann statistics to resolve system-wide
                        properties at a high-throughput
                        (HT) level. To maximize efficiency and accessibility, we integrated the method within the
                        automatic
                        HT computational
                        framework AFLOW. As proof of concept, we apply our approach to three systems of interest, a zinc
                        chalcogenide (ZnS<sub>1−x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub>), a
                        wide-gap oxide semiconductor (Mg<sub>x</sub>Zn<sub>1−x</sub>O), and an iron alloy
                        (Fe<sub>1−x</sub>Cu<sub>x</sub>),
                        at various stoichiometries. These systems exhibit
                        properties that are highly tunable as a function of composition, characterized by optical bowing
                        and
                        linear ferromagnetic
                        behavior. Not only are these qualities successfully predicted, but additional insight into
                        underlying physical mechanisms is
                        revealed.

                        mixed oxide by populating a single sublattice with many distinct cations. The formulations
                        promote
                        novel and entropy-stabilized forms of crystalline matter where metal cations are incorporated in
                        new
                        ways. Here, through rigorous experiments, a simple thermodynamic model, and a five-component
                        oxide
                        formulation, we demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that entropy predominates the thermodynamic
                        landscape, and drives a reversible solid-state transformation between a multiphase and
                        single-phase
                        state. In the latter, cation distributions are proven to be random and homogeneous. The findings
                        validate the hypothesis that deliberate configurational disorder provides an orthogonal strategy
                        to
                        imagine and discover new phases of crystalline matter and untapped opportunities for property
                        engineering.

                        are excellent n-type thermoelectric materials owing to their high electronic mobility and
                        higheffective mass, combined with low thermal conductivity associated with the addition of
                        filler
                        atoms into the void site. Thefavourable electronic band structure in n-type CoSb<sub>3</sub> is
                        typically attributed to threefold degeneracy at the conduction band minimum accompanied by
                        linear
                        band behaviour at higher carrier concentrations, which is thought to be related to the increase
                        in
                        effective mass as the doping level increases. Using combined experimental and computational
                        studies,
                        we show instead that a secondary conduction band with 12 conducting carrier pockets (which
                        converges
                        with the primary band at high temperatures) is responsible for the extraordinary thermoelectric
                        performance of n-type CoSb<sub>3</sub> skutterudites. A theoretical explanation is also provided
                        as
                        to why the linear (or Kane-type) band feature is not beneficial for thermoelectrics.

                        <br /><span>Abstract:<br /></span> The interest in plasmonic technologies surrounds many emergent optoelectronic applications, such as plasmon lasers, transistors, sensors and information storage. Although plasmonic materials for ultraviolet–visible and near-infrared wavelengths have been found, the mid-infrared range remains a challenge to address: few known systems can achieve subwavelength optical confinement with low loss in this range. With a combination of experiments and ab initio modelling, here we demonstrate an extreme peak of electron mobility in Dy-doped CdO that is achieved through accurate ‘defect equilibrium engineering’. In so doing, we create a tunable plasmon host that satisfies the criteria for mid-infrared spectrum plasmonics, and overcomes the losses seen in conventional plasmonic materials. In particular, extrinsic doping pins the CdO Fermi level above the conduction band minimum and it increases the formation energy of native oxygen vacancies, thus reducing their populations by several orders of magnitude. The substitutional lattice strain induced by Dy doping is sufficiently small, allowing mobility values around 500 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for carrier densities above 1020 cm<sup>-3</sup>. Our work shows that CdO:Dy is a model system for intrinsic and extrinsic manipulation of defects affecting electrical, optical and thermal properties, that oxide conductors are ideal candidates for plasmonic devices and that the defect engineering approach for property optimization is generally applicable to other conducting metal oxides.

                        <br /><span>Abstract:<br /></span> The accurate prediction of the electronic properties of materials at a low computational expense is a necessary condition for the development of effective high-throughput quantum-mechanics (HTQM) frameworks for accelerated materials discovery. HTQM infrastructures rely on the predictive capability of density functional theory (DFT), the method of choice for the first-principles study of materials properties. However, DFT suffers from approximations that result in a somewhat inaccurate description of the electronic band structure of semiconductors and insulators. In this article, we introduce ACBN0, a pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional that yields an improved prediction of the band structure of insulators such as transition-metal oxides, as shown for TiO<sub>2</sub>, MnO, NiO, and ZnO, with only a negligible increase in computational cost.</div>
